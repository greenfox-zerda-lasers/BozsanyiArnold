  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="foo">
      <div class="bar"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
#### Your answer: [2p]
Since there is no other relative option , the box positioning will take the body itself as relative.From the top-left corner the distance supposed to be which the code positioning on the box (means if we say top:20px; and left:20px; then its going to be that far awaz from the top left pixel.).

## 3. Explain concepts (~15 minutes) [4 points]
Add your answer to this readme file, commit your changes to this repository.


### Explain the difference between `display: block` and `display: inline` in CSS! What is `display: inline-block`?
#### Your answer: [2p]
'display:block;' is a display mode which displays any element as a block. Which is important to know about it , that no other element could get next to it generally , since block level elements using 100% width. You can use display inline , if you want to put any content next to your block level element.With 'display:inline-block;' you can even put a block level element next to your block level element.

### What is the difference between a `<section>` and an `<article>` element? Name one good example of using an `<article>`.
#### Your answer: [2p]
Article is a self-contained composition. It is mostly good to hold articles, like a blog , or an actual article.
Section on the other hand could mean any separated seciton on the site or even a part of it.
